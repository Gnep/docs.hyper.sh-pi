## Fees for Use of the Hyper.sh Services

- `4.1` Subject to the Terms, the Hyper.sh Services is provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services.

Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Hyper.sh incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Hyper’s measurements of your use of the Hyper.sh Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Hyper.sh and only in the form of credit for the Hyper.sh Services.

You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Hyper.sh may be shared by Hyper.sh with companies who work on Hyper’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Hyper.sh and servicing your account. Hyper.sh may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims.

Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.
