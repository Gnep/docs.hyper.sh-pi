Benefits
-----------------------------

_Pi_ gets out of the way where it matters, by making the processes of running containers as simple and fast as possible, so that companies can _run as many containers as as they want, at anytime, without preparing anything_.

- **INSTANT PROVISIONING** - In most cases, _Pi_ takes only **3 seconds** to provision new containers from scratch. It is by far the fastest in the market.

- **NO CLUSTER TO MANAGE** - With Pi, you no longer need to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers. It lets you **focus on running workloads, no distraction of servers, nor distraction of clusters.**.

- **JUST-IN-TIME SCALING** - _Pi_ allows applications to scale with **JIT** manner, thus eliminates the need to prepare extra capacity for peak.

- **COST EFFICIENT** - _Pi_ uses a **Per Second** pricing model. Spin up 100 containers in 3 seconds, run 30s, shutdown in 1s, and only pay for 3+30+1=33s.

- **PERSISTENT DATA** â€“ Run stateful workloads with Pi's persistent volume. Multiple replicas will be automatically created with each volume to protect your data from failures.

- **PRIVATE NETWORK Network (FREE)** - _Pi_ creates default private network for each user. Your container traffic is safely isolated from the rest. And the best part is that all traffic is FREE!
